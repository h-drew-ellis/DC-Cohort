#As an admin you should be able to see all the tables (12) 
#- As an admin each table in the list should show, whether the table is OCCUPIED or NOT OCCUPIED. 


#- As an admin if the table is OCCUPIED then show the start time of the table, number of minutes played. 
# (Hardmode - If the minutes are > 60 then show them in terms of hours) 

#- As an admin you can only give out the tables that are NOT OCCUPIED. 
# This means if pool table 8 is occupied and you try to give it out then 
# the app will print a message saying "Pool Table 8 is currently occupied". 

#- As an admin whenever I close the table it should write an entry in the text 
# file / json file. The file should be named in the following format: 
# (11-22-2017.txt or 11-22-2017.json) keeping track of all the tables. 
 

# The entry can consists of the following information: 

#Pool Table Number 

#Start Date Time

#End Date Time 

#Total Time Played 

#Cost (if you are doing the hard mode)
