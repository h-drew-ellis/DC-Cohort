Activity - User and Address
Create a class called User which consists of (first_name, last_name) properties. Create a class name Address which consists of (street, city, state, zip_code) properties. 

Create a relationship between User and Address in a way that a single user can have multiple addresses. 

Add a new method/function to User class called add_address(self, address) which would take an address as an argument and add it to a list/array of addresses. 

Add another method to the User class called display_addresses(self) which would display all the addresss of that user
